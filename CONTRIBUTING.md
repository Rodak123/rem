To start dev you must run:
```bash
bun install
bun tauri dev
```

# Backend orientation
For better understanding, how the Backend works, we
separate each major functionalities of Backend into multiple
folders.

What does the backed do? Here's everything what the Backend
does and will do:

- **Audio manipulation**: Backend at the start creates new thread
    with channel sender. This is your main way to request new
    changes to audio player, like volume, play, pause changes
    and so on.
- **Audio info emitter (Getting audio values)**: During the run
    Backend sends every 250ms (this value can be changed during
    the development) runtime information about the audio or the
    audio player into Frontend, which can listen to this channel.

    When new track is loaded, Backend also sends new information
    about this track. This may change to regular invoke. To
    be precise the `load_track` invoke could just send also the
    track.

    Currently only way to get audio options is by invoking
    `get_options`. These values doesn't make sense to send
    through emitting, because you need to get values
    from a file on start and afterwards you have the freshest
    data already in Frontend, because it's the place, where you
    are setting them.
- **Crawling folder for new files**
- **DB, Cache and Configuration manipulation**

So it's even more clearer, here's current version of backend folder with comments
to understand, which part does what:
