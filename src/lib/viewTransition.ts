/* If you want to nerd about the transition,

 * It's quite simple. You put data properties
 * on element (vt function is recommended for it)
 * and than use withTransition function and that's it.
 * On each call of withTransition will clean the
 * transition elements and reapply the names based
 * on the scope. Afterwards the webview does the
 * rest with the calculation. Don't know if
 * it is enough, but hopefully it is :P
